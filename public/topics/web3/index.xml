      <description>Quantum decentralized applications This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to create web3 applications that run on distributed quantum networks and protocols. Quantum decentralized applications can harness the quantum properties of coherence, entanglement, and superposition to enable more secure and robust functionality, such as quantum voting, quantum auctions, quantum games, and quantum social networks. Some examples of quantum decentralized applications are QVote, QubitDAO, and QubitBook.
Quantum cryptography This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to enhance the security and privacy of web3 communications, transactions, and contracts.</description>
