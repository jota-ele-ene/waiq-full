      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ben Buchanan and Tantum Collins argues in Foreign Affairs for a new American model of artificial intelligence development based on a “grand bargain” between the tech industry and the government. This agreement would balance innovation with ethical oversight and security concerns. The authors emphasize the need for government involvement to regulate AI while incentivizing private sector investment and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we consider some of the use cases of integrating quantum computing with artificial intelligence and web3 technologies, focusing on the technical aspects and challenges involved. We hope that they inspire and inform the experts and enthusiasts of these fields to pursue further exploration and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;quantum-finance&#34;&gt;Quantum finance&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the use case of applying quantum cloud, quantum machine learning, and quantum internet to enhance the efficiency and security of DeFi web3 services and applications, such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, stablecoins, and insurance. Quantum finance can enable faster and more accurate price discovery, risk analysis, portfolio optimization, and fraud detection, as well as more robust and scalable encryption, authentication, and verification. Some examples of quantum finance projects are Q2B, QC Ware, QuantFi, and QED-it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
