                <p>The patent system has historically been one of the pillars of the
innovation ecosystem: it offers an economic incentive to those who create;
that is, there is the expectation of an economic benefit generated in exchange
for the temporary transfer of the use of their inventions. But if part of the
creative process is taken over by AI, how do we redefine the value,
authorship, and protection of what has been invented?</p>

Several quantum science companies have gone public so far in 2025, marking a
pivotal year for the commercialization of quantum technology. Francisco
Castro, our WAIQer turn into a Quantum Investor, predicted this summer in our
course in Boston that there would be more quantum companies listed on the
stock exchanges. Standouts like Infleqtion and Xanadu have captured attention
with high-profile SPAC deals, joining other established names in shaping the
future landscape of quantum research and applications. This post reviews their
market entries, business focus, and what might unfold in the months ahead.

                <p>Ben Buchanan and Tantum Collins argues in Foreign Affairs for a
new American model of artificial intelligence development based on a “grand
bargain” between the tech industry and the government. This agreement would
balance innovation with ethical oversight and security concerns. The authors
emphasize the need for government involvement to regulate AI while
incentivizing private sector investment and leadership. </p>
