      <description>&lt;p&gt;The patent system has historically been one of the pillars of the innovation ecosystem: it offers an economic incentive to those who create; that is, there is the expectation of an economic benefit generated in exchange for the temporary transfer of the use of their inventions. But if part of the creative process is taken over by AI, how do we redefine the value, authorship, and protection of what has been invented?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ben Buchanan and Tantum Collins argues in Foreign Affairs for a new American model of artificial intelligence development based on a “grand bargain” between the tech industry and the government. This agreement would balance innovation with ethical oversight and security concerns. The authors emphasize the need for government involvement to regulate AI while incentivizing private sector investment and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
