      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we consider some of the use cases of integrating quantum computing with artificial intelligence and web3 technologies, focusing on the technical aspects and challenges involved. We hope that they inspire and inform the experts and enthusiasts of these fields to pursue further exploration and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;quantum-finance&#34;&gt;Quantum finance&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the use case of applying quantum cloud, quantum machine learning, and quantum internet to enhance the efficiency and security of DeFi web3 services and applications, such as decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, stablecoins, and insurance. Quantum finance can enable faster and more accurate price discovery, risk analysis, portfolio optimization, and fraud detection, as well as more robust and scalable encryption, authentication, and verification. Some examples of quantum finance projects are Q2B, QC Ware, QuantFi, and QED-it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;quantum-decentralized-applications&#34;&gt;Quantum decentralized applications&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to create web3 applications that run on distributed quantum networks and protocols. Quantum decentralized applications can harness the quantum properties of coherence, entanglement, and superposition to enable more secure and robust functionality, such as quantum voting, quantum auctions, quantum games, and quantum social networks. Some examples of quantum decentralized applications are QVote, QubitDAO, and QubitBook.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;quantum-cryptography&#34;&gt;Quantum cryptography&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to enhance the security and privacy of web3 communications, transactions, and contracts. Quantum cryptography can exploit the quantum properties of no-cloning, uncertainty, and entanglement to enable key distribution, encryption, authentication, and verification that are immune to eavesdropping, tampering, and forgery by classical or quantum adversaries. Some examples of quantum cryptography protocols are quantum key distribution, quantum digital signatures, quantum secure direct communication, and quantum blind signatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;quantum-machine-learning-platforms&#34;&gt;Quantum machine learning platforms&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to provide web3 with scalable and interoperable platforms for developing, deploying, and running quantum machine learning applications. Quantum machine learning platforms can leverage the quantum advantages of speedup, accuracy, and complexity to enable more efficient and effective data processing, feature engineering, model training, and inference. Some examples of quantum machine learning platforms are Qiskit Machine Learning, PennyLane, TensorFlow Quantum, and Amazon Braket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
