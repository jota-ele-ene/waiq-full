###Quantum decentralized applications
This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to create web3 applications that run on distributed quantum networks and protocols. Quantum decentralized applications can harness the quantum properties of coherence, entanglement, and superposition to enable more secure and robust functionality, such as quantum voting, quantum auctions, quantum games, and quantum social networks. Some examples of quantum decentralized applications are QVote, QubitDAO, and QubitBook. 

###Quantum cryptography
This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to enhance the security and privacy of web3 communications, transactions, and contracts. Quantum cryptography can exploit the quantum properties of no-cloning, uncertainty, and entanglement to enable key distribution, encryption, authentication, and verification that are immune to eavesdropping, tampering, and forgery by classical or quantum adversaries. Some examples of quantum cryptography protocols are quantum key distribution, quantum digital signatures, quantum secure direct communication, and quantum blind signatures. 

###Quantum blockchain
This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to improve the scalability and efficiency of web3 distributed ledgers, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts. Quantum blockchain can leverage the quantum phenomena of superdense coding, teleportation, and error correction to enable faster and more reliable data transmission, storage, and processing among the nodes of the network. Some examples of quantum blockchain platforms are QRL, Qubitica, and Quantum Resistant Ledger. 

###Quantum cloud computing
This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to provide Web3 users and developers with access to quantum computing resources, services, and applications. Quantum cloud can offer the advantages of quantum computing without the need for owning or maintaining quantum hardware, which is often costly and complex. Quantum cloud can also enable the sharing and trading of quantum computing power and data among the participants of the web 3.0 ecosystem. Some examples of quantum cloud providers are IBM, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. 

###Quantum machine learning
This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to enhance the performance and functionality of web3 artificial intelligence systems, models, and applications. Quantum machine learning can exploit the quantum capabilities of parallelism, interference, and amplitude amplification to enable faster and more accurate data analysis, feature extraction, optimization, and inference. Quantum machine learning can also leverage the quantum resources of coherence, superposition, and entanglement to enable more complex and expressive data representations, transformations, and computations. Some examples of quantum machine learning algorithms are quantum support vector machines, quantum neural networks, quantum variational circuits, and quantum generative adversarial networks. 

###Quantum internet
This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to create a web3 network that can connect quantum devices, systems, and applications across different locations and scales. Quantum internet can provide web 3.0 with more interoperable and integrated quantum computing platforms, services, and markets, as well as new possibilities for quantum communication, computation, and collaboration. Quantum internet can also enable web3 users and developers to access and utilize remote quantum resources, such as qubits, gates, measurements, and algorithms, in a secure and efficient manner. Some examples of quantum internet protocols are quantum network coding, quantum routing, quantum repeaters, and quantum relays. 

###Quantum web
This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to create a web3 interface that can facilitate the interaction and integration of quantum and classical information, systems, and applications. Quantum web can provide web3 with more user-friendly and accessible quantum computing tools, environments, and experiences, as well as new opportunities for quantum education, innovation, and entertainment. Quantum web can also enable web 3.0 users and developers to create and consume quantum content, such as quantum games, quantum art, quantum music, and quantum media, in a rich and immersive way. Some examples of quantum web platforms are Quirk, Qiskit, and Qibo.
