description: Quantum computing and artificial intelligence are two fields that
  can benefit from each other in multiple ways. Quantum computing can provide
  artificial intelligence with faster and more efficient algorithms, data
  structures, and hardware, while artificial intelligence can help quantum
  computing with optimization, error correction, and interpretation of quantum
  data. Some of the use cases of quantum computing and artificial intelligence
  are listed here.

### Quantum optimization

This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to solve optimization problems, such as finding the minimum or maximum of a function, the best configuration of a system, or the optimal solution of a constraint satisfaction problem. Quantum optimization can leverage the quantum phenomena of tunneling, annealing, and adiabatic evolution to escape local optima and explore the solution space more efficiently than classical optimization methods. Some examples of quantum optimization algorithms are quantum annealing, quantum approximate optimization algorithm, and quantum alternating operator ansatz.

### Quantum simulation

This is the application of quantum algorithms and hardware to simulate the behavior and dynamics of quantum systems, such as molecules, atoms, materials, and fields. Quantum simulation can offer a more accurate and faithful representation of quantum systems than classical simulation methods, which often suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the sign problem. Some examples of quantum simulation algorithms are quantum phase estimation, quantum variational eigensolver, and quantum imaginary time evolution.
