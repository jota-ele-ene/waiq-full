This is a <strong>Spotlight</strong> element, and it's generally used &ndash; as its name implies &ndash; to spotlight a particular feature, subject, or pretty much whatever. You can customize its <span class="demo-controls">appearance with a number of modifiers</span>, as well as assign it an optional <code>onload</code> or <code>onscroll</code> transition modifier (<a href="#reference-spotlight">details</a>).
